It's better than [Laravel Auditing](http://www.laravel-auditing.com/) since it offers also the possiblity to version Many-to-many relations.

Finds errors in your code without actually running it. 
It catches whole classes of bugs even before you write tests for the code.

## Commercial packages

### Laravel Ray
Allows a better debugging experience then dump() and dd().  
Especially to debug AJAX stuffs.  
[spatie/laravel-ray](https://myray.app/)


### Laravel Tinkerwell
It's a PHP code editor on steroids.
Allows to run any PHP code locally or even directly in production.

Once set the work directory as the one of the project we are working on,
allows interacting directly with the db data and to see the output of **Eloquent** and **Collection** methods.

I found out that it helps to speed up my dev flow since I can play with the data checking the output immediately, and without writing code in the project I'm working on.
